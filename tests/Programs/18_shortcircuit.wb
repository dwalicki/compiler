Short-circuit evaluation.
Note: Implementing this is likely to be tricky/messy. 
Come back to it later if you have other things to fix.*/

var x = 1;
var y = 0;

print true || (x/y == 0);       // Does NOT evaluate x/y
print false && (x/y == 0);      // Does NOT evaluate x/y

/* Short circuit evaluation also applies to chained comparison */

print 3 < 2 < x/y;       // Does NOT evaluate x/y
