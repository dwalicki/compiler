   Assignment is an expression in Wabbit.  That means that it can be used
   anywhere an expression is expected, including in print statements,
   while loops, and so forth.   Structurally, assignment looks similar
   to a binary operator like +.  Thus, you can parse it in a similar
   way.  However, assignment is also right-assocative meaning that
   `x = y = n + 2` gets structured as `x = (y = n + 2)`.

```

x = 1;
print x = 1;
while (n = n + 1) < 10 {
   print n;
}
x = y = 2;      // Note: should be structured as x = (y = 2);
