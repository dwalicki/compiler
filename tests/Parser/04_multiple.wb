/* 04_multiple.wb

   Modify your parser so that it can parse multiple statements.  You'll
   need to write code that collects statements into a list of some kind.
   One way to do this is to write a parsing rule involving a loop:

   def parse_statements(parser):
       statements = [ ]

       while True:
           statement = parse_statement(parser)
	   statements.append(statement)
	   
       return Statements(statements)
	   
   However, a tricky part of this is knowing when you need to stop looping.
   You might need to peek ahead to see if you're at the end of the file
   or a statement block.  If so, you'd break out of the loop and return a
   a result.
