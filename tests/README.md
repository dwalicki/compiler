This directory contains different test input programs for stages 
of the Wabbit project.  You might want to copy files to your own
directory so you make edits while working on the project.

Model/
    These are *very* simple working programs that you will manually encode
    into the data model that you've defined at the start of the
    project.  You can also use these to test your interpreter.

Parser/
    These are programs solely designed for getting the parser to work.
    These are not runnable programs--they are solely meant for parser
    testing.

Programs/
    These are correct working programs that try to exercise more
    features of the compiler.  Only work on these after you have a
    parser working.

Error/
    These programs have errors that could be detected by your compiler.
    This would be good to give the type-checking part of your compiler.
